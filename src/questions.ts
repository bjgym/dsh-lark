/**
 * Intent confirmation in the chat. When a model needs a decision before it can
 * continue, the host's `ask_user_question` reaches for `ctx.userQuestions` —
 * a seam that admits ONE provider per context, which a composed Web app claims
 * for its own clients. A chat agent asking through it would wait on a surface
 * its human is not watching, which is why this channel used to deny the tool
 * outright and tell the model to ask in prose instead.
 *
 * A prose question loses the structure: the options the model weighed, which
 * one the human picked, and the fact that an answer is due at all. So the tool
 * is SHADOWED instead — an agent-scoped registration of the same name, which
 * the host's layered registry resolves before the global one (its registry
 * reserves exactly one name from shadowing, and it is not this one). The
 * question becomes a card with the model's own options as buttons; a click
 * answers it, and so does an ordinary chat reply, because typing an answer is
 * what a person does when none of the buttons fit.
