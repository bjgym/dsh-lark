/**
 * The question panel this channel's conversations render in the Web composer.
 *
 * The interaction flow mirrors the shipped question composer: one question per
 * page with a pager, an explicit skip, a dismissal that withdraws a
 * tool-call-keyed panel, a cancel that ends a request nothing could bring back,
 * validation that no question goes unanswered by accident, a countdown the user
 * can freeze, an answer surface that holds the deadline while it has focus,
 * drafts that survive a strict Session entry remount, and the read-only review
 * card a settled call is read back through.
 *
 * On top of that it keeps the one state the shipped panel cannot reach: a
 * request the log shows was already answered by another surface — the Feishu
 * chat, in the deployment this was built for. That request's panel has stopped
 * deciding anything, so this one says so and settles it instead of waiting for
 * a press that would be discarded.
 *
 * The card state (countdown, wait presentation, channel, closed) comes from the
 * request object's own public observable face. The shipped composer reads the
 * same state through its registration's `keyedHooks` seat, which belongs to the
 * package this channel does not depend on; the request object publishes it for
 * exactly this purpose, so the panel reads the source directly rather than
 * taking a second presentation package as a dependency.
 *
 * Plan reviews stay with the shipped panel: this channel answers plans through
 * its own shadowed tool in the chat, so this entry claims only `question`
 * interactions.
 *
 * The panel is the TEMPORARY half of a two-surface question; see the plugin
 * entry for why the durable fix belongs in the gateway.
 * @module dsh-lark-channel/client/QuestionPanel
