/**
 * Live settled-request reads for the conversations this channel drives.
 *
 * One source per session id, created on first use and kept for the page's
 * lifetime: a conversation the browser has open may settle a request at any
 * moment, and a source that is torn down between panels would have to replay
 * the window to answer the same question again.
 *
 * The skeleton — borrow the binding, follow its window, recompute, publish only
 * on change, remember what this page settled itself — is the same for every
 * domain this channel answers on two surfaces. What differs is only how the
 * window folds and what identifies one settled item, so those two are injected
 * through {@link SettledRead} and the rest is shared.
 *
 * Every consumer here is the TEMPORARY browser half of a two-surface request;
 * see the plugin entry for why the durable fix belongs in the gateway.
