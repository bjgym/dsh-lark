/**
 * Browser half of the Lark channel: the approval panel the Web composer renders
 * in place of the shipped one.
 *
 * Registered as a `dsh.client` row so the Web module table loads it beside the
 * other browser plugins. It claims no service the Host half owns; every value
 * it reads comes from the shared Client services.
 *
 * An approval is offered on two surfaces at once — the channel's Feishu card
 * and whatever answerer follows its Host listener — and the first answer wins.
 * When another surface wins, this page's copy of the question has already
 * stopped deciding anything, and the shipped panel leaves it standing because
 * retiring it is the Host's call. This plugin supplies the missing half: it
 * renders that panel itself and settles a request the log shows another surface
 * already decided.
 *
 * The entry claims EVERY approval, and that reach is a property of the
 * mechanism rather than a choice. A chain selector is a pure function of the
 * owner props — the session id, the session snapshot, and the pending request —
 * so it can read no live fact, and "is a chat currently driving this
 * conversation" is a live fact that exists only on the Host: in the binding
 * table, or in the channel's own session projection. A session id does not
 * carry it either, because `/sessions` lets a chat continue a session it did
 * not derive. Claiming narrowly by name therefore missed real conversations,
 * and the request it missed is exactly the one whose shipped panel keeps its
 * buttons after the chat has already decided.
 *
 * TEMPORARY. The shipped approval panel keeps its buttons after the chat
 * answers because the gateway settles a forwarded request only when a client
 * replies or the request's lifetime ends, so a chat-side win has no way to
 * reach the browsers already holding the question. The durable fix belongs
 * there — either the gateway cancels delivered clients when an earlier listener
 * claims the waterfall, or the channel registers inside `forwardWaterfall` and
 * shares one settlement with the browser. When that lands, this whole browser
 * half should be deleted rather than extended.
