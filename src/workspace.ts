/**
 * Per-conversation workspaces. `/cd` points one conversation at a directory,
 * and the conversation's session id is derived from BOTH facts, so every
 * (conversation × directory) pair owns a durable session of its own. That turns
 * a host constraint into the feature: a session's cwd is fixed at creation, so
 * "switching" is really reaching a different session — and coming back to a
 * directory resumes the context that was built there instead of erasing it.
 *
 * The mapping persists through the host settings service, in the same section
 * that already holds onboarded credentials, so a restarted process routes every
 * conversation to the session it served before. Entries never need deletion —
 * the persistence layer deep-merges patches — so "back to the default" is an
 * explicit marker value rather than an absent key.
