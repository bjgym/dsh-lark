/**
 * The permission preset, as a thing a chat can see and change.
 *
 * The host owns both knobs — how far the sandbox lets a command reach, and
 * whether an action that needs approval gets to ask — and pairs them into
 * named presets switched by `/permission <name>`. The command already takes
 * that argument; a chat could always switch, it just had to know the name and
 * type it. So this module is not new capability, it is the same capability
 * with a surface: read the current preset, offer the others, and switch by
 * running the host's own command.
 *
 * One property of the shipped table has to reach the person pressing the
 * button. `danger-full-access` is not only "stop confining" — it also sets the
 * approval policy to `never`, and `never` means an action that still needs
 * approval is REFUSED rather than waved through. Someone who reads the name as
 * "allow everything" would be half right and half wrong, which is the worst
 * way to be wrong about a permission.
